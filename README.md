# ML-based-prediction-of-CR-related-genes
Here you will find four folders 'Datasets', 'Code', 'Features Importance' and 'CR-probability'.

The 'Datasets' folder contains csv files of each one of the datasets used in this work.

The 'Code' folder is split  in three internal folders: 
  * 'Datasets construction' which contains R files each of wich is focused on retrieving different types of features and constructing the datasets.
  * 'Machine learning' which contains python files for conducting the ML predictions and features importance computations.
  * 'Results analysis' which contains R and python files for perfoming the statistical tests on features importance and performing the CR-probability analysis of the genes. 
  
The 'Features Importance' folder contains csv files of the feature importance analysis of {GO terms, BRF} and {PathDIP, CAT}..

The 'CR-probability' folder contains cvs files of the predicted CR-probabiliy scores assigned to genes in {GO terms, BRF} and {PathDIP, CAT}.
